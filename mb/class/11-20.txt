Bank and our economy
	Banks became well regulated monopoly
	Government deal that they would let banks stay big, but not make too much money
	Eventually government let other lending to go on.
	By early 2000s mortgages and mortgage back securities became a big part of the deal:
		Mortgages and mortgage back securities are the colatteral
		Formerly, colatteral  was provided by treasuries.  By early 2000s, there aren't securities to satisfy world demand.
		Preferred colatteral was US Treasuries.  When there aren't enough of them to support repo, you have to figure out an alternative.
